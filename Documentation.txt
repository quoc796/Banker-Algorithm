Receiving input from file input.txt 
Input format:
  1: number of processes (p), number of resources types (r)
  2: Allocation matrix of size pxr (allocation)
  3: Max matrix of size pxr (allocation)
  4: Available array of size r (available)
Output:
  If encouter deadlock: System encouter deadlock
  else : safe sequence


    Steps of main function: 
        receiving input and assign input to p, r, allocation, max, available
        enter bank algorithm
    Bank algorithm:
        compute need matrix and assign into needed
        loop through processes to determine which process allocated resources can be released
            determine by check if need < available: 
              true: release process allocation -> retrieve allocated resources into available -> add this process to safe sequence -> go back to check unreleased process
        check if all processes entered safe sequence:
            true: print safe sequence
            false: print encouter deadlock
